This is the `kicadts` typescript library. It's still in early developement and
we're trying to make sure we parse the entire KiCad S-expression specification.

You can find the difference specifications in the `references` directory, the
most extensive one is `references/SEXPR_MAIN.adoc`.

- `references/SCHEMATIC_SEXPR.adoc`
- `references/PCB_SEXPR.adoc`
- `references/FOOTPRINT_SEXPR.adoc`
- `references/SCH_SYM_SEXPR.adoc`
- `references/SEXPR_MAIN.adoc`
